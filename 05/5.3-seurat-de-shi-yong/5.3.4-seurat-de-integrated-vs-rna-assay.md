# 5.3.4 Seurat的integrated vs RNA assay

> 内容来自：[https://www.biostars.org/p/399789/](https://www.biostars.org/p/399789/)

主要探讨多个数据利用Seurat整合后，会出现integrated 和 RNA assay

那么它们的**区别在哪里呢？**

### Q1：What is this integrated assay and how/why is it different than "RNA".

* This is the data after integration. You can think of it as **batch-adjusted** data. 也就是说integrated assay是校正完批次效应后的数据
* data integration process will return a matrix with "corrected" value. Set DefaultAssay to "integrated" means your following analysis will on the "corrected" value. 
* Set DefaultAssay to "RNA" means your following analysis will on the original value.
* You can use integrated data to do clustering. But it is not proper to use integrated for DE, and most tools only accept raw counts for DE.

### Q2：What are the consequences of NOT changing it and leaving RNA as the default

* If you do not switch to `integrated` assay, you will not be working with integrated data. 
* If you are not interested in the integrated data, then you don't need to perform integration. If you just want to combine two Seurat objects without any additional adjustments, there a `merge` function and [a vignette for that workflow](https://satijalab.org/seurat/v3.1/merge_vignette.html).
